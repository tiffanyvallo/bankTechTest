# Bank Tech Test in JavaScript

## Requirements
You should be able to interact with your code via the JavaScript console.
Deposits, withdrawal.
Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria
Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
When she prints her bank statement

```
date       || credit  || debit  || balance
14/01/2012 ||         || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 ||        || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 ||        || 1000.00
```
## Planning and Approach: 

### Approach
- With the given requirements, I created [user stories](#user-stories) and [edge cases](#edge-cases)
- I decided to create 3 classes, `Account`, `Transaction` and `Satement` in order to maintatin single responsibility principle
- To help understand what I needed for each class, I created a domain model to help understand what I intended what each class would hold
